    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I had always had an interest in coding but never really pursued it until now.  At the begining of this year, I have decided to make a change in careers.  While researching on the internet about coding, I came across an article of the popular languages right now. The article was on the Iron Yard's blog.  So I was curious about the Iron Yard and what they do, I visited their site and was very intrigue of what they offer.  So i applied and joined The Iron Yard to gain the knowledge and skill sets to be a junior web developer. </p>
